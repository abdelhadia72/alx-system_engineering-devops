# I/O Redirections and Filters in Shell Commands

Below are some commonly used I/O redirections and filters in shell commands:

1. `echo`: Display a line of text.
2. `cat`: Concatenate and display the contents of files.
3. `head`: Output the first part of files.
4. `tail`: Output the last part of files.
5. `find`: Search for files in a directory hierarchy.
6. `wc`: Print the number of lines, words, and bytes in files.
7. `sort`: Sort lines of text files.
8. `uniq`: Report or omit repeated lines in a file.
9. `grep`: Print lines matching a pattern.
10. `tr`: Translate or delete characters.
11. `rev`: Reverse lines of a file.
12. `cut`: Remove sections from each line of files.

The following are some common I/O redirections and filters used with shell commands:

- **Input Redirection (`<`)**: Redirects the input of a command from a file.
- **Output Redirection (`>`)**: Redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it exists.
- **Appending Output Redirection (`>>`)**: Redirects the output of a command to a file, appending the output to the file if it exists.
- **Error Redirection (`2>` or `2>>`)**: Redirects the error output (stderr) of a command to a file.
- **Piping (`|`)**: Connects the output of one command to the input of another command, allowing for data processing through a series of commands.
- **Filtering with `grep`**: Filters the input by matching lines that contain a specified pattern.
